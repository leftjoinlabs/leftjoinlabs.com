Hi I'm Sean.
I'm passionate about using software for social justice, which is why I've chosen to make a career out of CiviCRM development.
I've been using, administering, and customizing CiviCRM since 2008 when I set up CiviCRM for an awesome non-profit in Boston called [Bikes Not Bombs](https://bikesnotbombs.org).
For seven years I was their do-all IT person and worked heavily with CiviCRM.
In 2017 I shifted focus to CiviCRM *development*.
I'm still learning the ropes but eager to take on more projects.
When I'm not coding, I enjoy: mountain biking, trail running, open water swimming, rock climbing, and woodworking.
