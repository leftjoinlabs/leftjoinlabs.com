### Sean Madsen

Hi I'm Sean. I'm passionate about using software for social justice, which is why I've chosen to make a career out of CiviCRM development. I've been using, administering, and customizing CiviCRM since 2008. I was the do-all IT person for an awesome non-profit in Boston called [Bikes Not Bombs](https://bikesnotbombs.org) for seven years where I worked heavily with CiviCRM. In 2017 I shifted focus to CiviCRM *development*. I'm still learning the ropes but eager to take on more projects. When I'm not coding, I enjoy: mountain biking, tail running, open water swimming, rock climbing, and woodworking.
